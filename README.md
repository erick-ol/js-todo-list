## To-Do List
This was a project developed in the [Software Development Course at Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web) as a challenge while I was learning how to manipulate DOM with JavaScript. On the application the user is able to create a task, select it, finish it and erase it.

### How to download and run the project code

First of all you need to download the project files, you can do this using git.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:erick-ol/js-todo-list.git
```

Then you just need to enter the application folder and open your ```index.html``` file on the browser.
